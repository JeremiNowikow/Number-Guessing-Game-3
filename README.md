# Number-Guessing-Game-3
This is a browser-based number guessing game. The user will be asked to imagine a number between 1 and 1000. The program will attempt to guess it.

The user has access to three buttons: "too small", "too big" or "correct" to control the flow of the game and direct the
program to help it find the correct number.
